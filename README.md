# PHP: Unexpected isset() Behavior with Variable Variables and Type Juggling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to variable variables and type juggling.  The issue involves the `isset()` function and how it behaves when the variable name is dynamically determined and its type changes.

The bug showcases how PHP's loose typing can lead to unexpected results, making it crucial to carefully manage variable types when working with variable variables.

## Bug Description

The core problem lies in the implicit type conversion performed by PHP when using variable variables. When the name of the variable variable changes type, the `isset()` function might behave unexpectedly.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `bug.php` using a PHP interpreter. Observe the output. 
4. Examine `bugSolution.php` to see how to mitigate this behavior. 

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on using stricter type handling and avoiding potential ambiguity by using more explicit variable names.

In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with variable variables and unexpected type juggling. Consider this scenario:

```php
$dynamicVarName = 'someValue';
$$dynamicVarName = 10; //Creates a variable named 'someValue' with value 10

if (isset($$dynamicVarName) ) {
    echo "Variable '" . $dynamicVarName . "' is set";
}

$dynamicVarName = 123; //Changing the value of $dynamicVarName

if (isset($$dynamicVarName) ) {
    echo "Variable '" . $dynamicVarName . "' is set";
}
```

You might expect the second `isset` check to fail because `$dynamicVarName` is now an integer, not a string. However, PHP's loose typing allows it to treat `$dynamicVarName` as a string in the context of variable variables. Therefore, the second `isset` check will also evaluate to true, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.  The actual variable that is checked is `$123`, not `$someValue` anymore. This is because PHP implicitly converts `123` to a string within the context of the variable variable.  This can result in the accidental creation and modification of unintended variables leading to hard to track down bugs.
